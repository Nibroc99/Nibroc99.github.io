# Corbin M. Blanchard's Resume - last updated: *May of 2019*.
I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript to make this site.  Learning how to work with the JS elements and how to use JQuery was a serious learning curve for me and took up most of my time on this project.  I have to say that I did not expect to have such difficulty with the modals before I included the use of JQuery - that basically just made everything...  Work.  I'm glad that I had the opportunity to work with this stuff more and get to know how it works and re-familiarize myself with the ideas of how classes and IDs can work together.
  Something that I'd like to note is that I had originally planned to code my own project site for each of the featured projects.  This proved to be a very big task, however, and was not going smoothly at all, so I decided to scrap the idea and just have the cover images link to my already-existing portfolio project pages made using Adobe Portfolio.  Everything else, however, was coded from scratch with minimal use of other people's code.  The modals were quite a large amount of borrowed code, but I still customized it to make it my own.
    All of that being said, I will definitely be takign this new knowledge and HTML wizardry into the real world.  The company I work for in my spare time, NFI Corp., needs a lot of help in re-coding their website - and I think I can help them work out the kinks now with the new info I've gained from this class.
